<p>Babymetal is a <b>Japanese kawaii metal band</b>. The group is composed of Suzuka Nakamoto as "Su-metal" (singing and dancing) and Moa Kikuchi as "Moametal" (screaming and dancing). The group is produced by Kobametal of the talent agency Amuse. Their vocals are backed by heavy metal instrumentation, performed by a group of musicians known as the "Kami Band" during performances.
<br>The band was formed in 2010, with the original line-up of Su-metal (Vocal and Dance), Moametal (Scream and Dance), and Yui Mizuno as "Yuimetal" (Scream and Dance), with the concept of creating a fusion of heavy metal and Japanese idol genres. Originally, Babymetal was a sub-unit of the Japanese idol group Sakura Gakuin.
<br>It became an independent band in 2013, after Nakamoto left Sakura Gakuin. Babymetal released their self-titled debut album in February 2014. Their second album, Metal Resistance, was released worldwide on April 1, 2016. Babymetal has also embarked on several tours, the majority of which are outside of Asia.</p>
